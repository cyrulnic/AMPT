# AMPT
R code of statistical signicance computations for ensemble predictions with AMPT model perturbations

The repository contains R code and raw data to compute p-values using a bootstrap test and the Student's t-test.

The folder  NearSurfaceFields  contains code and embedded raw data to compute the p-values for 
verifications of near-surface temperature and wind speed (verification against weather stations).
Run the *_mp.R script.

The folder  FreeAtmosphere  contains code and files with raw data necessary to compute the p-values for 
verifications of free-atmosphere temperature and wind speed (verification against ECMWF analyses).
Run the *_mp.R script.
